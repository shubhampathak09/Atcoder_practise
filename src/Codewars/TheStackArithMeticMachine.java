    The Stack Arithmetic Machine
    This time we're going to be writing a stack arithmetic machine,
    and we're going to call it Sam.
    Essentially, Sam is a very small virtual machine,
    with a simple intruction set, four general registers,
    and a stack. We've already given a CPU class,
    which gives you read and write access to registers and the stack,
    through readReg() and writeReg(), and popStack() and writeStack() respectively.
    All instructions on Sam are 32-bit (Java int),
    and either interact with the stack, or one of the 4 registers; a, b, c, or d.
