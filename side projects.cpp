What are good side projects to get better at data structures and algorithms?
0) Build a Sudoku Solver & Checker ! It just needs RECURSION. Add UI if you can. ( Coders start numbering things from 0, not one, so the 0th bullet point :P )

1) Make a PHONEBOOK using TRIE data structure.

2) Build a game like Flappy Bird - It will need Object Pool Data Structure to recycle objects on the screen. Many libraries have an implementation of Objects Pool, but you can also design your object pool using an array.

3) Build a game like Space-Shooter, you can use data structure like - Quad Tree ( Space Partitioning Data Structure) to optimize the collision detection method between bullets and enemy objects.Brute force collision detection becomes slow and when number of objects on screen increase.

4) Build your own library of data structures - Provide custom implementations of Hashtables, Generic Trees, Stacks, Priority Queue etc with extra features.

5) Build a Snakes & Ladders game, challenge the player to win in minimum number of moves. You can use BFS to compute it.

6) Make an application like Google Maps - You can use Dijkshtra’s algorithm to find the shortest paths, A* Search for more efficient & real time use.

7) Use a string compression algorithm, like Run Length Coding or Huffman Coding, devise your own algorithm to make a project on data compression.

The list is endless. You can think of ideas and work on it. Coding is all about PROBLEM Solving. Look what’s wrong in your surroundings and try to solve it with your knowledge and skills. Hope this helps !
