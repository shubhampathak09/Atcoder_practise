You can set up a mock service endpoint to help with local testing by using a library like WireMock. WireMock is a library for stubbing and mocking web services. It enables you to test your application by creating a mock endpoint that can simulate the behavior of the actual web service that your application interacts with.

You can create a standalone HTTP server that provides a set of endpoints that you can use to simulate various scenarios, such as service unavailable, slow response times, or incorrect responses. This allows you to test your application locally without the need for a live connection to the actual web service.

Here's a simple example of how you can set up a mock endpoint using WireMock:

Add the WireMock dependency to your build system (e.g. Gradle or Maven).
Create a new instance of the WireMockServer class.
Configure the mock endpoint by defining the HTTP request method, URI pattern, and response details.
Start the WireMock server.
Point your application to the mock endpoint instead of the real one.
Run your tests.
After your tests have completed, you can stop the WireMock server.
