Amazon DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database service that charges for both read and write capacity units and for data storage.

Here is an overview of the billing costs for various operations in DynamoDB:

Read Capacity Units: Charged for each read operation, such as a GetItem or Query request, that retrieves data from the table. The cost depends on the number of items read and the size of the items.

Write Capacity Units: Charged for each write operation, such as a PutItem or UpdateItem request, that writes data to the table. The cost depends on the number of items written and the size of the items.

Data storage: Charged based on the amount of data stored in the table, including the size of items and any local secondary indexes (LSIs) or global secondary indexes (GSIs). The cost is calculated on a monthly basis.

Provisioned throughput: DynamoDB provides the option to reserve a certain amount of read and write capacity units, which can help ensure consistent performance. The cost of provisioned throughput is calculated based on the number of capacity units reserved.

Query operations: Querying data in DynamoDB is charged based on the number of items read and the size of the items. If you are using a GSI, query operations will also consume GSI read capacity units.

Insert, update, and delete operations: These operations consume write capacity units, which are charged based on the number of items written and the size of the items. Updating a GSI field also consumes GSI write capacity units.

It's important to monitor your usage of DynamoDB and adjust your provisioned throughput and data storage as needed to ensure optimal performance and minimize costs. You can use the AWS Cost Explorer to view your DynamoDB usage and costs, and the DynamoDB Console to monitor the performance of your tables and indexes.


There are many examples of NP problems, including:

Traveling Salesman Problem: Given a list of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Knapsack Problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the combination of items that maximizes the value while keeping the total weight below a given limit.

Graph Coloring Problem: Given an undirected graph, determine the smallest number of colors that can be used to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Subset Sum Problem: Given a set of integers, determine whether there exists a subset of the numbers that adds up to a given target.

Clique Problem: Given an undirected graph, determine the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a clique) that can be found in the graph.

Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT): Given a Boolean formula, determine whether there exists an assignment of values to the variables that makes the formula true.

3-SAT Problem: A variant of the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, where the input formula consists of clauses with exactly three literals.

Hamiltonian Cycle Problem: Given a graph, determine whether there exists a simple cycle that passes through every vertex exactly once
